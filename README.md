Operias
=======

Operias is an open source tool that produces a coverage difference report between two versions of a software project. Operias can be run as a standalone version (operias-report) that creates a coverage diff report for two given versions of code, the other is a tool that provides integration with GitHub Pull Requests (operias-servlet). Currently, Operias supports only maven based Java projects, future extensions will support other Java build tools.

Demo
=======
For a short demo on how this tool works please watch the video at https://youtu.be/2Dpigi5ghZE

Compilation of the tool
=======

To compile the operias-report standalone tool, the following command should be issued in the operias-report directory.
```
  mvn clean compile assembly:assembly -DskipTests=true
```

For the operias-servlet tool, it is important that the operias-report tool is installed in your local maven repository. This can be acheived with the aid of the following command in operias-report directory:

```
  mvn install
```

The operias-servlet tool can then be compiled using the command:

```
  mvn clean compile assembly:assembly -DskipTests=true
```

Running Operias Report

The operias-report tool can be executed using the following command:
```ini
  java -cp '<path-to-operias-report>/target/operias-report-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar' operias.Main <args>
```

This table shows all the possible flags that can be used when running operias-report.

Parameter | Short parameter name | Description | 
----------|----------|-----------|
--destination-directory | -d | The directory where the generated site will be placed
--revised-directory | -rd | This directory contains the revised source code, this directory will be compared to the original directory. This should be the project directory containing the main pom.xml.
--original-directory | -od | This directory contains the original source code, unchanged. This should be the project directory containing the main pom.xml.
--repository-url | -ru | Instead of providing a directories containing the versions, you can also give a git url. Operias will clone the repository into it's own temporary repository directory.

--original-commit-id | -oc | Operias will checkout to this commit to use as original source code. 
--original-branch-name | -obn | Operias will checkout to this branch to use as original source code. 
--revised-repository-url | -oru | The git url used for the revised version of the source code.
--revised-commit-id | -rc | Operias will checkout to this commit to use as revised source code.
--revised-branch-name | -rbn | Operias will checkout to this branch to use as revised source code.
--temp-directory | -td | If Operias fails to execute, it is possible it does not have the rights to create a temporary folder, use this parameter to set your own temporary directory for Operias. Be aware, it will delete all the contents of the temporary folder when the execution has completed
--verbose | -v | Provide this parameter enable the output of errors, warnings and info messages
